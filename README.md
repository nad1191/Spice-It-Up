# Spice-It-Up

Can you handle the spice
Sweet peppers(green)- lose 5 points
Spicy peppers(red)- gain 10 points

Use your mouth to catch the flying peppers/

Spice meter (points) either increase/decreases

You’re in a hot pepper contest to see if you can out beat your opponent, the problem is your opponent is slipping in sweet peppers to bring your spice o meter down. Reach 50 points within the time limit to beat your opponent if you do you’ll be named the spice king if not you’ll be banished from all things spicy. 

Use left and right keys to move the mouth and catch the spicy peppers, be careful not catch the sweet ones.
